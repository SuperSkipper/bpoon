                Night Light is a game created during the 2018 Athens Game Jam over the
                period of two days. It recieved the accolade of "Best Overall Game" 
                along with "Best Art" among others. The game is centered around the 
                exploration of a mysterious house with various monsters spread throughout. 
                Vision is limited to a spotlight generated by the protagonist's lantern. 
                All of the art was drawn in-house by the wonderfully-talented Maddi
                Huff and the audio was created by Henry Mcgehee and Mahima Dhesi. 
                Night Light represents my first foray into video game design/development.
                As such, there are some unpolished parts throughout.

                The team responsible for creating Night Light consisted of seven individuals
                including myself. In total, there were three developers, one artist, two
                audio engineers, and one storyboard writer. The formation of this team was
                completely impromptu and was done right at the start of the event. The members
                are as follows:<br><br>
                Benjamin Poon - Project Lead, Programmer<br>
                Kelly Gallagher - Lead Programmer<br>
                Andrew Kristanto - Programmer<br>
                Maddi Huff - Principal Artist<br>
                Henry Mcgehee - Audio Engineer<br>
                Mahima Dhesi - Audio Engineer<br>
                Austin Ward - storyboard
