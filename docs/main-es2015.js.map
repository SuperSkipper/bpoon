In addition to simply wanting to do something productive while staying home\r\n        during the COVID-19 crisis, another goal in the development of this website was to serve as an exercise in familiarizing myself\r\n        with Google's Angular framework.

With this website being my first project in\r\n        Angular, I learned most if not all of Angular's fundementals through its creation. Various concepts such as component handling, routing and routing animations,\r\n        data binding, dependency injection, and so on were completely foreign to me before making this website. Furthermore, creating this current iteration of\r\n        my personal website has also allowed me to futher refine the modern minimalist aesthetic that I enjoy capturing in my work.

Born into a poor family in Columbus, Georgia, Pridget started her early career at the age of 14 by performing in minstrel acts before moving on to singing in\n    traveling vaudeville performances. Through her travels within these performances, she met Willian \"Pa\" Rainey, who would eventually go on to become\n    her husband. This is also when Pridget, now Rainey, took up the stage Name \"Ma\" in conjuction with William's \"Pa\". She would perform with Pa as a duo\n    act for about a decade before the two separated. During her career as a singer, she became one of the first females to record blues professionally.\n    Renouned for her strong \"moaning\" style of singing, she would very regularly sell out theaters and draw huge crowds of both White and African American attendees.\n    Lyrically, much of her music were written to reflect the hardships faced by a woman living in her age. Rainey would later go on to associate with Paramount\n    and perform with \"some of the finest musicians of the day\". Sadly, she passed away on December 22nd, 1939 due to heart complications.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>Countin’ the Blues</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2hbxUOhbVyqxIoLxk2AM0c\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Being one of the pieces introduced in the book, Countin' the Blues is a very \"by-the-books\" blues song by modern day standards. It is performed in the 12-bar format and\n    follows the AAB format very rigidly. Every stanza of the piece features prominent vocals in the first two verses, which are then decorated at the end by a cornet on the third.\n    In a sense, even the rhyme scheme follows this pattern, with the last words of the first two verses of every stanza being the same and then last word of the third being different,\n    but still rhyming with the first two. Overall, the piece evokes a melancholic mood as the instruments languish behind Ma's singing. Lyrically, the piece seems to fuse parts of\n    gospel music into its roots as a blues composition, with many verses addressing \"Lord\" in a manner not unlike praying.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>Black Eye Blues</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3KuHKNc4l0ryqWuglWAYrG\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Following very closely to Ma's modus operandi when it comes to writing her lyrics, the focus of this piece is on a woman stuck in an abusive relationship with her husband.\n    The piece simultaneously puts emphasis on the protagonist's strength by later focusing on her plotting to eventualy catch her man with his \"britches down\", showing that she\n    is not just idly allowing him to abuse her.

In fact, he was one of the most primere performers of\n    gospel blues to have ever existed. So influential was he, that his work <i>Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground</i> was one of the songs chosen\n    to be enscribed on the the Voyager Golden Records as a representation of human culture on Earth.<br><br>\n    Born in a small town just south of Waco, Texas, Johnson lost his birth mother at a very young age. His blindness was later inflicted by a stray lye bottle\n    thrown by his mother-in-law meant for his dad. Due to this blindness, Johnson mostly relied on play music in the streets to earn money. During this time,\n    he played mostly blues before later moving onto gospel as his religious affiliations deepened. Later, Johnson went on to record multiple records with his wife Angeline at\n    Columbia Records and became one of their best-selling race recording artists. After leaving the recording industry in 1930, Johnson continued performing on\n    the streets of Texas before unfortunately succumbing to pneumonia shortly after his house burned down in 1947.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2P9nh9pTK96dE0b6NBbTSs\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    This is the fabled song that is now on the payload of both Voyager 1 as well as Voyager 2. The piece itself contains both vocal as well as instrumental sections,\n    but there are no descernable spoken words during any part of the performance. With both its name and its structure beign derived from the English hymn Gethsemane,\n    the song's mournful and languishing moaning featured throughout was meant to draw a powerful image of Christ's grief and sorrow during the eve prior to his\n    Crucifixion. This mood is even further expressed through the inclusion of various blues practices such as note-bending.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>The Soul of a Man</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5UEsyERm7tsNvDDZFylZZf\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    The Soul of a Man was performed as a duo between Johnson and Willie B. Harris, with Harris singing the harmony during the refrains. The song itself questions the spiritual nature of Man's soul. It captures and\n    ponders this idea around a tune that is distinctly blues-like in its composition. These factors may have been influenced by the Great Depression, which had gripped the American populace prior to its publishing.\n    Like many of his other works, the only other instrumentation beyond vocals is a guitar playing harmony throughout the piece.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    Works Cited\n  </h2>\n  <p style=\"text-indent: 0px;\">\n    Layne, Joslyn \"Blind Willie Johnson.\" AllMusic. 08 April 2021.

A selection of these individuals include singers Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, and even\n    some prison inmates. Additionally, a brief history of the tune is also covered within the film. With its words written in 1772 by\n    clergyman John Newton, the song itself is a slow, methodical piece that can be sung in either a monophonicor a polyphonic manner. The nature\n    of the piece allows for a variety of interperetations. The film showcases several renditions ranging from solo performances, to a vocal performance\n    accompanied by a guitar, to full choral performances. Naturally then, each rendition also has their own individual idiosyncracies. Judy Collins' rendition,\n    for example, features extremely drawn-out notes with vigorous vocal vibrato. Johnny Cash's performance on the other hand, was comparatively more brisk\n    and featured more pronounced pauses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This will by no means be a complete list, but some of the locations featured within the film included Philidelphia, Kentucky, Texas, Alabama, Missisippi,\n    New York City, and even London. While much of the venues were cathedrals or churches, some other more uncommon ones included a prison, a backyard, a school,\n    and even a graveyard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Over time, <i>Amazing Grace</i> has also experienced various changes. As previously mentioned, the nature of the song allowed for a variety of interperetations\n    to develop according to each individuals performer's preferences. As a result, the song has been adapted to a variety of situations and time periods. When the\n    hymn was first created, for example, the entire song was sung without any vocal portamento or vibrato. As time went on, both of those became more and more commonly-\n    practiced. The same could be said about instrumental accompaniment, as the piece was originally indended to be sung a capella.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finally, I think what stood out to me the most about the film was the versatility of the song. Prior to watching the film, I never really considered all of the situations\n    and circumstances during which the could be/is used.\n  </p>\n\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p6',\n  templateUrl: './p6.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p6.component.css']\n})\nexport class P6Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<br>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 6: African American Performers in Minstrelsy</h1>\n  <p>\n    During the course of module 5, one particular not-so-covered topic that stood out to me were the African American performers in minstrel shows.\n    More specifically, I was interested in learning about their motives in performing in shows that were meant to denigrate their own race. This\n    interest was what served as the inspiration for this portfolio post.\n  </p>\n  <h2>Pre-Civil War</h2>\n  <p>\n    Prior to the civil war, there were only two known minstrelsy performers that were African American. These two individuals were William Henry Lane and\n    Thomas Dilward. Overall, documentation on these individuals seemed to be somewhate sparse at best. Thomas Dilward was said to have been an excelent singer,\n    dancer, actor, and violinist. He was also born with dwarfism, which severely hindered him from performing tasks that were typically expected of someone\n    of his skin color back in the day. As such, he came to primarily rely on entertainment to support himself. On stage, however, Dilward's disability actually\n    served as an advantage, getting him into minstrel troupes that ironically would otherwise never allow Black performers join. Due to both his dwarfism as well\n    as his abilities, it was likely that the reason Dilward chose to perform in minstrels was purely for the sake of supporting himself.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    William Henry Lane, on the other hand, was even less well-documented. In fact, even his name is up for speculation, as he primarily went by the name of Master Juba.\n    His motivations for performing in minstrels seem to have been due to his affinity for dance. In that sense, he competed and won against even the very best white\n    minstrel dancers at the time. He would later go on to become extremely successful in the European circuit.\n  </p>\n  <h2>Post-Civil War</h2>\n  <p>\n    After the Civil War, more and more exclusively black minstrel troupes began to appear. These groups of performers often touted that their performances were authentic in comparison to their white minstrel\n    counterparts. In fact, many of the African American minstrel troupes included the word \"Georgia\" in their name in an effort to convey to their audience that their performers were\n    genuine slaves prior to the Civil War. Meanwhile, the primary motivator for these performers seems to also have been for the purposes of self-sustinance, as black minstrels usually paid better\n    than most other occupations that were available to them at the time. Additionally though, many African American minstrel shows also subtly subverted black sterotypes while also\n    making fun of aspects of white culture. Though the real reason is still debated by historians, this may also have contributed to the comparatively large crowds of African American\n    audiences that Georgia Minstrels commonly drew.\n  </p>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Works Cited</h2>\n    <p>Blumberg, Naomi and Yalzadeh, Ida. \"Master Juba\".

The film follows various civil rights experts and activists as they recount the history of the civil rights\n    movement with a musical context. Additionally, the film also features artists John Legend, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Joss Stone,\n    Blind Boys of Alabama, Mary Mary, Richie Heavens, Anthony Hamilton, and Angie Stone.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Being a film about music during the civil rights movement, it should not be surprising that all of the featured songs are, or are derived from, protest\n    songs. As such, much of the film's music share similar characteristics. For example, true to their name, many of the protest songs were sung during protests.\n    More specifically, they were sung during protests as a means to help protesters stay strong in the face of adversity. Therefore, content-wise, many of the songs\n    featured within the film revolve around the themes of hope and solidarity. Additionally, due to the circumstances under which these songs were sung\n    (in jails and public spaces not meant for music), many of them were sung monophonically in a somewhat impromptu manner by the protesters with no\n    accompaniment of any kind. The exception to this was when the featured artists were depicted performing within a studio setting.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    When looking at how the music featured in the film has changed over time, the foremost important aspect to recognize is its change in purpose.\n    Like mentioned previously, during the days of the civil rights era, these pieces were performed primarily to inspire strength and perserverance\n    within its performers. In modern times, however, these types of songs are sung in an effort to inspire rememberance of the suffering endured by those in the\n    past. The result of this shift in purpose is that the songs have adopted a more somber tone in the recent years in comparison with the past.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    I'm not sure if this counts, but when I was watching the film, one thing that really stood out to me was the sheer number of scenes that featured the modern artists with\n    no musical context regarding how it related to the topic being discussed. To me, this seemed a bit irrelevant, as I didn't quite understand how those tied into\n    the story that the film was trying to convey.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p8',\n  templateUrl: './p8.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p8.component.css']\n})\nexport class P8Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<br>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 8: Film Review (A Third Time)</h1>\n  <p>\n    This week's film was <i>America's Blues</i>. It featured interviews with a pretty massive cast of various individuals ranging from musicians, to\n    artists, to academics. This admittedly massive cast includes, but are not limited to Big George Brock, David Dee, Watermelon Slim, Harry Webber,\n    Sharon Lewis, amongst others. The film, along with the individuals depicted within it, documented the origins of blues along with all that it\n    influenced. Indeed, it was surprising for me to learn that blues' tendrils of influence even reached aspects of life such as sexuality and fashion.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Starting off with the setting, the film encompases a multitude of locations. Of the locations that were actually filmed for the production, very few,\n    if any, were actually directly named. The venues in which the interviews were recorded seem to all be local to where the interviewees were. As such,\n    they ranged from art galleries, to recording studios, to even living rooms. The locations/events covered historically on the other hand, were named. The American\n    Folk Fest held in Europe was one such location/event. The film also talks about the rise of blues in the Mississippi and Arkansas Deltas. Other historical locations\n    covered included Atlanta's 7 Stages Theatre and Storyville, New Orleans.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    The background music heard throughout the film seems to be a blend of jazz, blues and rock instrumental tracks that served to give the viewer an idea of the music that\n    was being talked about at the time. There were, however, also sections of the film that featured the music it self, rather than having it just be in the background.\n    From my recollection, blues music were the most prominently featured, but rock and roll as well as jazz were also heavily featured. There were even instances where\n    the film featured work songs and hip hop. Overall, most of the featured music sounded relatively slow and relaxed to me. There were not very many fast passages and\n    everything seemed to be very relaxed.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    With the film being about blues' influence, it should be no surprise that it covered the evolution of blues into jazz and rock and roll, both musically, as well as culturally.\n    Overall, the film does a pretty good job at connecting aspects of both jazz and rock to their roots in blues. With rock and roll in particular, the film describes the genre as\n    talking blues and \"whitening it a little bit\". As such, many of the rhythms and even some of the riffs in rock and roll have their origins in blues.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Overall, what really stood out to me in the film was the sheer amount of things that were influenced by blues. Particularly surprising to me was its influence on\n    on American sexuality. It would have never occurred to me that blues sort of acted as a gateway for sex to become a more openly talked about subject. It was also interesting\n    and novel to hear about the idea that blues can act as a living story about the evolution of culture.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-week2',\r\n  templateUrl: './week2.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./week2.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class Week2Component implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","\r\n\r\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\r\n    <h1>Music in My Family</h1>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When I was growing up, my mom did quite a lot to ensure that music played part of my life.\r\n      Back when she was growing up in China, my mom could never afford to buy any musical instruments\r\n      or a teacher to teach her. She didn't have the time either, as most of her time was spent taking\r\n      care of my two uncles while my grandparents were at work. Seeing this missed oppurtunity in the past\r\n      was essentially the reason why my mom encouraged me to become musically literate.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Despite there being little formal musical education in my family, there was certainly still a taste\r\n      for it. My grandparents, for example, always loved to listen to Chinese operas in their free time.\r\n      My mom on the other hand, always enjoyed 80's mandopop along with some of the artists here in the US\r\n      like Celine Dion. Beyond that, I also remember her having piles of cds back in the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p>\r\n      As for my musical history, I can't say I remember a part of my life that wasn't impacted by music.\r\n      I've spent years of my life both listening to as well as playing music. I started learning the piano\r\n      in kindergarten and the violin in first grade. I got into music production in high school, and lately\r\n      I've been trying to pick up the guitar. I've also spent more money than I'd care to admit buying instruments,\r\n      hi-fi speakers and headphones, audio systems, and records.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-night-light',\r\n  templateUrl: './night-light.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./night-light.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class NightLightComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<div>\r\n    <button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"./select\">\r\n        <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\r\n        <p>Back</p>\r\n    </button>\r\n    <a href = \"https://github.com/SuperSkipper/Night-Light\">\r\n        <img src = \"./assets/icons/GitHubWhite.svg\" id= \"git\">\r\n    </a>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"content\">\r\n    <div id=\"content-body\">\r\n        <div id=\"title-block\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/white_title.png\" alt=\"white_title\" id=\"title-img\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/main-character.png\" alt=\"Main Character\" id=\"title-character\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/title_screen.jpg\" id=\"ts\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Night Light is a game created during the 2018 Athens Game Jam over the\r\n                period of two days.
