transition from a WordPress website into something fully-custom that would afford\r\n        me more control regarging the overall design and content. In addition to simply wanting to do something productive while staying home\r\n        during the COVID-19 crisis, another goal in the development of this website was to serve as an exercise in familiarizing myself\r\n        with Google's Angular framework. That being said, this is my first ever website developed with Angular. Eventually,\r\n        this knowledge will be applied toward learning hybrid app development through the Ionic SDK.\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>What I've learned</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <img src=\"./assets/bpoon/Code.PNG\" alt=\"animation code\" style=\"width: 400px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black; float: left; margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n        Before I started working on this website, I did not have much knowledge beyond basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in terms of web development. As the development of\r\n        this website went on, I began to pick up more and more aspects of both Angular as well as web design in general. With this website being my first project in\r\n        Angular, I learned most if not all of Angular's fundementals through its creation. Various concepts such as component handling, routing and routing animations,\r\n        data binding, dependency injection, and so on were completely foreign to me before making this website. Furthermore, creating this current iteration of\r\n        my personal website has also allowed me to futher refine the modern minimalist aesthetic that I enjoy capturing in my work. The result of this learning is a\r\n        fully hand-built website that I am truly proud to call my own.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-f2',\n  templateUrl: './f2.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./f2.component.css']\n})\nexport class F2Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Final 2: <i>The Phantom of the Opera (2004)</i></h1>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Introduction</h2>\n    <img src=\"../../../../assets/musi2040/PotO.jpg\" alt=\"movite poster\" style=\"float: right; height: 300px; margin-left: 20px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black;\">\n    <p>\n      For my final portfolio post, I chose to re-watch and review one of my favorite musical films: <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>. In my opinion, not only has Andrew Lloyd\n      Webber's vision been excellently adapted to the silver screen, but the music that was presented along with it was also absolutely beautiful. Overall, I was just as impressed\n      watching it now as I was the first time many years ago, if not more so. Overall, I was very happy that I got to watch this again\n    </p>\n    <h2>Plot Synopsis (Spoilers Obviously)</h2>\n    <p>\n      Our story follows our protagonist Christine Daaé's (Emmy Rossum) experiences as an up-and-coming prima donna at her opera house after the\n      previous one stormed off. The events that follow depict the development of a relationship between Christine and a suitor by the name\n      of Raoul de Chagny (Patrick Wilson). This relationship, however, is complicated by the fact that the titular Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler),\n      whom Christine owes her singing skills, is also romantically interested in her. Throughout the film, The Phantom wreaks havoc at the opera house\n      in retribution to both the new theater owners for disobeying his wishes as well as Christine for failing to reciprocate his romantic interest.\n      After attempting to make Christine love him, The Phantom is finally convinced by her at the film's climax to abandon his unrequited\n      love and to leave her and Raoul in peace.\n    </p>\n    <h2>General Musical Review</h2>\n    <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvkAM1FOnAk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"float: right; margin-left: 20px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black;\"></iframe>\n    <p>\n      Given that a majority of the dialogue in this production is delivered through song, it should be no surprise that music plays an extremely critical role in the\n      content of this film. Many, if not most of the conversations between characters are actually duets, with the characters taking turns performing the solo sections in a drawn-out\n      form of call and response. There are also monologues that are sung purely in a solo fashion by a single actor however. Additionally, several musical numbers feature\n      and entire choral section. These particular numbers are usually accompanied by a heavily-choreographed mass spectacle. The video to the right displays one of such\n      spectacles, performed to the song <i>Masquerade</i>.\n    </p>\n    <br>\n    <p>\n      It should also be obvious by now that with the significant importance of music to the production, the orchestra also plays an immensely critical role in the story.\n      The most obvious role is the presentation of the various leitmotifs, the most prominent of which is the organ riff that accompanies The Phantom anytime his character\n      appears. Other leitmotif reprises are also used to accent thematic elements of the story as well. The best example of this that I could think of is the\n      downward leap featured most prominently in the first measure of <i>All I Ask of You</i> being reprised to represent a longing for love.\n    </p>\n    <br>\n    <h2>Scene Discussion</h2>\n    <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zy1lWiHHHFY\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black;\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>\n      Without a doubt, let me say here and now that <i>All I Ask of You</i> is my absolute favorite song in the entire film.  As such, the scene in which it is\n      sung is the one that I chose to discuss. The context behind it is that The Phantom has just hung one of the stagehands during a performance. As a result of this,\n      Christine and Raoul have escaped onto the roof of the opera house to find solace from danger. The song serves as an affirmation from Raoul that he will\n      be Christine's pillar in her time of need as well as Christine's affirmation of her reciprocated affection for him. Meanwhile, The Phantom looks on in the shadows,\n      simmering in jealousy.\n    </p>\n    <br>\n    <p>\n      It should be pretty obvious how important the music is in this scene considering that it is entirely delivered in the form of song. The leitmotif mentioned earlier\n      is in full force as the two lovers are longing for a future together. At the beginning of the scene, the timid and subdued playing from the orchestra directly reflects\n      the fact that both of the characters are still in a state of unease. Christine is still not entirely sure that Raoul will be able to offer her the freedom and\n      protection that she desires, and Raoul is not sure whether his affection for Christine is requited. As the song progresses, the increasingly lush and full sound\n      of the orchestra mirrors the growing confidence that the two have for each other as lovers. Finally, the massive swell towards the end conveys the burning passion\n      that the two feel now that they have affirmed each other's desires as they embrace and kiss for the first time.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Final Remarks</h2>\n    <p>\n      I hope that it was noticable that I actually enjoyed doing a portfolio post for once from the extra level of detail in this post. Like I said in the beginning,\n      <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> has always been one of my favorite musicals of all time. I still get goosebumps listening to it sometimes. While the continuity of\n      the story could use some work at some parts, the thematic elements are all there and make this production immensely satisfying to watch.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-musi-select',\n  templateUrl: './musi-select.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./musi-select.component.css']\n})\nexport class MusiSelectComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div id=\"title\">\n  <h1>Ben's MUSI 2040 Portfolio</h1>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../../../about\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 1: Introduction</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../Music_in_My_Family\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 2: Music in My Family</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P3\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 3: Ma Rainey</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P4\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 4: Blind Willie Johnson</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P5\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 5: Film Review</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P6\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 6: African American Performers in Minstrelsy</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P7\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 7: Film Review (Again)</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P8\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 8: Film Review (A Third Time)</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../P9\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Portfolio 9: The Final Post</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"project\" routerLink=\"../F1\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Final 1: Musical Web</h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n  <button class = \"projectLast\" routerLink=\"../F2\">\n    <div>\n        <h1>Final 2: <i>The Phantom of the Opera (2004)</i></h1>\n    </div>\n    <img class = \"arrow\" src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-right.svg\" alt = \"Chevron\">\n  </button>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Router, RouterOutlet} from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-musi2040-portfolio',\r\n  templateUrl: './musi2040-portfolio.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./musi2040-portfolio.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class MUSI2040PortfolioComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  prepareRoute(outlet: RouterOutlet) {\r\n    return outlet && outlet.activatedRouteData && outlet.activatedRouteData['animation'];\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor(private router: Router) { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<div id=\"backing\">\r\n  <div [@project]=\"prepareRoute(outlet)\">\r\n      <router-outlet id = \"routerDiv\" #outlet=\"outlet\"></router-outlet>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-musical-web',\n  templateUrl: './musical-web.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./musical-web.component.css']\n})\nexport class MusicalWebComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Final 1: Musical Web</h1>\n  <h2><i>Maple Leaf Rag</i></h2>\n  <p>\n    Looking back at this listening log, while I was indeed familiar with the piece at the beginning of the course, there were definitely some new things that\n    I recognized after listening to it again.

Particularly noticeable to me was its\n    energetic bassline that was later reflected in much of jazz.\n  </p>\n  <h2><i>Walk This Way</i></h2>\n  <p>\n    Personally, after having gone back to this song, I have to say that I don't quite understand why it was introduced so early into the course. With this song being\n    a fusion between rock and hip hop, I personally think it would have been more prudent to introduce this after the context of jazz. Especially with the rock aspects\n    of the song, I think it would have been nice to get to know the roots of some of its riffs before getting introduced to it. As far as this song's place in the musical\n    web is concerned, I'd say that while its inspiration is derived from a multitude of the genres covered in the course, its relatively late release date makes its impact\n    on the other songs featured in the course somewhat minimal. Overall, I'd say that this song very much belongs in Candelaria's popular \"stream\". It essentially took the\n    mass appeal of both rock and hip hop and was able to draw an audience out of both crowds.\n  </p>\n  <h2><i>The Yankee Doodle Boy</i></h2>\n  <p>\n    I think that this listening log was definitely enhanced by Album 6, where band music is introduced. In general, I'd definitely say that the I noticed aspects of march\n    and by extension, field music scattered throughout the instrumental sections of the piece. Some prominent examples of this include martial drumming and the inclusion of\n    the fife in the instrumental sections. This song also shares many inspirational connections with other music. The most obvious of these are the direct references to these\n    pieces through either verbal or acoustic means. Perhaps the most obvious example of this is the reference to <i>Yankee Doodle</i> in both the song's name as well as the\n    tune.\n  </p>\n  <h2><i>Give the World a Smile</i></h2>\n  <p>\n    When I was listening to this song writing my listening log, I focused almost exclusively on the vocals. While the vocals do have a dominating presence in the song,\n    the instrumentation definitely still plays a part. After listening to it again for this assignment, I came to realize that I had basically tuned out the guitar\n    and I wasn't even aware that the piano was a part of the song in the past. Unlike the previous songs that were mentioned so far, I personally don't think that there\n    are very many connections with other pieces featured in the class. Of course, there was a connection to other gospel music and gospel's roots in folk music, but from\n    what I know, the song seems to be more of a musical island than the others.\n  </p>\n  <h2><i>KoKo (Charlie Parker & Dizzy Gillespie)</i></h2>\n  <p>\n    The cool thing with bebop is that there is usually always something new that you pick up as you give the song more successive listens. That was absolutely the case even\n    as I listen to it again now. I absolutely didn't realize that there were parts in the performance that were even repeated until now. The very abrupt stop at the end\n    for example, actually occurs towards the very beginning as well. Overall, I feel like KoKo very much belongs in the popular music stream. With its origins as a bebop\n    song being firmly rooted in the realms of jazz and blues, it's no surprise that KoKo makes references to other jazz pieces. The principal amongst these jazz pieces is\n    Ray Noble's <i>Cherokee</i>, of which the chords of <i>KoKo</i> are based off of.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p3',\n  templateUrl: './p3.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p3.component.css']\n})\nexport class P3Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 3: Ma Rainey</h1>\n\n  <p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\..\\assets\\musi2040\\MaRainey.png\" alt=\"Ma Rainey\" style=\"float: right; height: 300px; margin-left: 20px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black;\">\n    Gertrude Pridget was a quintessential figure in the world of blues, cerdited with helping to develop the genre into the incarnation that we know\n    today. Born into a poor family in Columbus, Georgia, Pridget started her early career at the age of 14 by performing in minstrel acts before moving on to singing in\n    traveling vaudeville performances. Through her travels within these performances, she met Willian \"Pa\" Rainey, who would eventually go on to become\n    her husband. This is also when Pridget, now Rainey, took up the stage Name \"Ma\" in conjuction with William's \"Pa\". She would perform with Pa as a duo\n    act for about a decade before the two separated. During her career as a singer, she became one of the first females to record blues professionally.\n    Renouned for her strong \"moaning\" style of singing, she would very regularly sell out theaters and draw huge crowds of both White and African American attendees.\n    Lyrically, much of her music were written to reflect the hardships faced by a woman living in her age. Rainey would later go on to associate with Paramount\n    and perform with \"some of the finest musicians of the day\". Sadly, she passed away on December 22nd, 1939 due to heart complications.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>Countin’ the Blues</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2hbxUOhbVyqxIoLxk2AM0c\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Being one of the pieces introduced in the book, Countin' the Blues is a very \"by-the-books\" blues song by modern day standards. It is performed in the 12-bar format and\n    follows the AAB format very rigidly. Every stanza of the piece features prominent vocals in the first two verses, which are then decorated at the end by a cornet on the third.\n    In a sense, even the rhyme scheme follows this pattern, with the last words of the first two verses of every stanza being the same and then last word of the third being different,\n    but still rhyming with the first two. Overall, the piece evokes a melancholic mood as the instruments languish behind Ma's singing.

The song seems to be sung in Rainey's signature \"moaning\" style and also seems to utilize the classic 12-bar blues pattern of composition.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    Works Cited\n  </h2>\n  <p style=\"text-indent: 0px;\">\n    Orr, N.

In fact, he was one of the most primere performers of\n    gospel blues to have ever existed. So influential was he, that his work <i>Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground</i> was one of the songs chosen\n    to be enscribed on the the Voyager Golden Records as a representation of human culture on Earth.<br><br>\n    Born in a small town just south of Waco, Texas, Johnson lost his birth mother at a very young age. His blindness was later inflicted by a stray lye bottle\n    thrown by his mother-in-law meant for his dad. Due to this blindness, Johnson mostly relied on play music in the streets to earn money. During this time,\n    he played mostly blues before later moving onto gospel as his religious affiliations deepened. Later, Johnson went on to record multiple records with his wife Angeline at\n    Columbia Records and became one of their best-selling race recording artists. After leaving the recording industry in 1930, Johnson continued performing on\n    the streets of Texas before unfortunately succumbing to pneumonia shortly after his house burned down in 1947.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2P9nh9pTK96dE0b6NBbTSs\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    This is the fabled song that is now on the payload of both Voyager 1 as well as Voyager 2. The piece itself contains both vocal as well as instrumental sections,\n    but there are no descernable spoken words during any part of the performance. With both its name and its structure beign derived from the English hymn Gethsemane,\n    the song's mournful and languishing moaning featured throughout was meant to draw a powerful image of Christ's grief and sorrow during the eve prior to his\n    Crucifixion. This mood is even further expressed through the inclusion of various blues practices such as note-bending.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <i>The Soul of a Man</i>\n  </h2>\n  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5UEsyERm7tsNvDDZFylZZf\" width=\"50%\" height=\"80\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px black\"></iframe>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    The Soul of a Man was performed as a duo between Johnson and Willie B. Harris, with Harris singing the harmony during the refrains. The song itself questions the spiritual nature of Man's soul. It captures and\n    ponders this idea around a tune that is distinctly blues-like in its composition. These factors may have been influenced by the Great Depression, which had gripped the American populace prior to its publishing.\n    Like many of his other works, the only other instrumentation beyond vocals is a guitar playing harmony throughout the piece.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    Works Cited\n  </h2>\n  <p style=\"text-indent: 0px;\">\n    Layne, Joslyn \"Blind Willie Johnson.\" AllMusic. 08 April 2021.

A selection of these individuals include singers Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, and even\n    some prison inmates. Additionally, a brief history of the tune is also covered within the film. With its words written in 1772 by\n    clergyman John Newton, the song itself is a slow, methodical piece that can be sung in either a monophonicor a polyphonic manner. The nature\n    of the piece allows for a variety of interperetations. The film showcases several renditions ranging from solo performances, to a vocal performance\n    accompanied by a guitar, to full choral performances. Naturally then, each rendition also has their own individual idiosyncracies. Judy Collins' rendition,\n    for example, features extremely drawn-out notes with vigorous vocal vibrato. Johnny Cash's performance on the other hand, was comparatively more brisk\n    and featured more pronounced pauses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This will by no means be a complete list, but some of the locations featured within the film included Philidelphia, Kentucky, Texas, Alabama, Missisippi,\n    New York City, and even London. While much of the venues were cathedrals or churches, some other more uncommon ones included a prison, a backyard, a school,\n    and even a graveyard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Over time, <i>Amazing Grace</i> has also experienced various changes. As previously mentioned, the nature of the song allowed for a variety of interperetations\n    to develop according to each individuals performer's preferences. As a result, the song has been adapted to a variety of situations and time periods. When the\n    hymn was first created, for example, the entire song was sung without any vocal portamento or vibrato. As time went on, both of those became more and more commonly-\n    practiced. The same could be said about instrumental accompaniment, as the piece was originally indended to be sung a capella.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finally, I think what stood out to me the most about the film was the versatility of the song. Prior to watching the film, I never really considered all of the situations\n    and circumstances during which the could be/is used.\n  </p>\n\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p6',\n  templateUrl: './p6.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p6.component.css']\n})\nexport class P6Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 6: African American Performers in Minstrelsy</h1>\n  <p>\n    During the course of module 5, one particular not-so-covered topic that stood out to me were the African American performers in minstrel shows.\n    More specifically, I was interested in learning about their motives in performing in shows that were meant to denigrate their own race. This\n    interest was what served as the inspiration for this portfolio post.\n  </p>\n  <h2>Pre-Civil War</h2>\n  <p>\n    Prior to the civil war, there were only two known minstrelsy performers that were African American. These two individuals were William Henry Lane and\n    Thomas Dilward. Overall, documentation on these individuals seemed to be somewhate sparse at best. Thomas Dilward was said to have been an excelent singer,\n    dancer, actor, and violinist. He was also born with dwarfism, which severely hindered him from performing tasks that were typically expected of someone\n    of his skin color back in the day. As such, he came to primarily rely on entertainment to support himself. On stage, however, Dilward's disability actually\n    served as an advantage, getting him into minstrel troupes that ironically would otherwise never allow Black performers join. Due to both his dwarfism as well\n    as his abilities, it was likely that the reason Dilward chose to perform in minstrels was purely for the sake of supporting himself.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    William Henry Lane, on the other hand, was even less well-documented. In fact, even his name is up for speculation, as he primarily went by the name of Master Juba.\n    His motivations for performing in minstrels seem to have been due to his affinity for dance. In that sense, he competed and won against even the very best white\n    minstrel dancers at the time. He would later go on to become extremely successful in the European circuit.\n  </p>\n  <h2>Post-Civil War</h2>\n  <p>\n    After the Civil War, more and more exclusively black minstrel troupes began to appear. These groups of performers often touted that their performances were authentic in comparison to their white minstrel\n    counterparts. In fact, many of the African American minstrel troupes included the word \"Georgia\" in their name in an effort to convey to their audience that their performers were\n    genuine slaves prior to the Civil War. Meanwhile, the primary motivator for these performers seems to also have been for the purposes of self-sustinance, as black minstrels usually paid better\n    than most other occupations that were available to them at the time. Additionally though, many African American minstrel shows also subtly subverted black sterotypes while also\n    making fun of aspects of white culture. Though the real reason is still debated by historians, this may also have contributed to the comparatively large crowds of African American\n    audiences that Georgia Minstrels commonly drew.\n  </p>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Works Cited</h2>\n    <p>Blumberg, Naomi and Yalzadeh, Ida. \"Master Juba\".

The film follows various civil rights experts and activists as they recount the history of the civil rights\n    movement with a musical context. Additionally, the film also features artists John Legend, Wyclef Jean, The Roots, Joss Stone,\n    Blind Boys of Alabama, Mary Mary, Richie Heavens, Anthony Hamilton, and Angie Stone.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Being a film about music during the civil rights movement, it should not be surprising that all of the featured songs are, or are derived from, protest\n    songs. As such, much of the film's music share similar characteristics. For example, true to their name, many of the protest songs were sung during protests.\n    More specifically, they were sung during protests as a means to help protesters stay strong in the face of adversity. Therefore, content-wise, many of the songs\n    featured within the film revolve around the themes of hope and solidarity. Additionally, due to the circumstances under which these songs were sung\n    (in jails and public spaces not meant for music), many of them were sung monophonically in a somewhat impromptu manner by the protesters with no\n    accompaniment of any kind. The exception to this was when the featured artists were depicted performing within a studio setting.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    When looking at how the music featured in the film has changed over time, the foremost important aspect to recognize is its change in purpose.\n    Like mentioned previously, during the days of the civil rights era, these pieces were performed primarily to inspire strength and perserverance\n    within its performers. In modern times, however, these types of songs are sung in an effort to inspire rememberance of the suffering endured by those in the\n    past. The result of this shift in purpose is that the songs have adopted a more somber tone in the recent years in comparison with the past.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    I'm not sure if this counts, but when I was watching the film, one thing that really stood out to me was the sheer number of scenes that featured the modern artists with\n    no musical context regarding how it related to the topic being discussed. To me, this seemed a bit irrelevant, as I didn't quite understand how those tied into\n    the story that the film was trying to convey.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p8',\n  templateUrl: './p8.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p8.component.css']\n})\nexport class P8Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 8: Film Review (A Third Time)</h1>\n  <p>\n    This week's film was <i>America's Blues</i>. It featured interviews with a pretty massive cast of various individuals ranging from musicians, to\n    artists, to academics. This admittedly massive cast includes, but are not limited to Big George Brock, David Dee, Watermelon Slim, Harry Webber,\n    Sharon Lewis, amongst others. The film, along with the individuals depicted within it, documented the origins of blues along with all that it\n    influenced. Indeed, it was surprising for me to learn that blues' tendrils of influence even reached aspects of life such as sexuality and fashion.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Starting off with the setting, the film encompases a multitude of locations. Of the locations that were actually filmed for the production, very few,\n    if any, were actually directly named. The venues in which the interviews were recorded seem to all be local to where the interviewees were. As such,\n    they ranged from art galleries, to recording studios, to even living rooms. The locations/events covered historically on the other hand, were named. The American\n    Folk Fest held in Europe was one such location/event. The film also talks about the rise of blues in the Mississippi and Arkansas Deltas. Other historical locations\n    covered included Atlanta's 7 Stages Theatre and Storyville, New Orleans.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    The background music heard throughout the film seems to be a blend of jazz, blues and rock instrumental tracks that served to give the viewer an idea of the music that\n    was being talked about at the time. There were, however, also sections of the film that featured the music it self, rather than having it just be in the background.\n    From my recollection, blues music were the most prominently featured, but rock and roll as well as jazz were also heavily featured. There were even instances where\n    the film featured work songs and hip hop. Overall, most of the featured music sounded relatively slow and relaxed to me. There were not very many fast passages and\n    everything seemed to be very relaxed.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    With the film being about blues' influence, it should be no surprise that it covered the evolution of blues into jazz and rock and roll, both musically, as well as culturally.\n    Overall, the film does a pretty good job at connecting aspects of both jazz and rock to their roots in blues. With rock and roll in particular, the film describes the genre as\n    talking blues and \"whitening it a little bit\". As such, many of the rhythms and even some of the riffs in rock and roll have their origins in blues.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    Overall, what really stood out to me in the film was the sheer amount of things that were influenced by blues. Particularly surprising to me was its influence on\n    on American sexuality. It would have never occurred to me that blues sort of acted as a gateway for sex to become a more openly talked about subject. It was also interesting\n    and novel to hear about the idea that blues can act as a living story about the evolution of culture.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-p9',\n  templateUrl: './p9.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./p9.component.css']\n})\nexport class P9Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"../select\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\n  <p>Back</p>\n</button>\n<div id=\"mainBody\">\n  <h1>Portfolio 9: The Final Post</h1>\n  <p>\n    For my final post, I figured I'd explore the prevalence and usage musical scores in beyond just the film industry. More specifically,\n    I'd like to explore the impact of scoring in video games. This topic in particular drew my interest as the primary difference between video games\n    and film are their respective degrees of audience participation. This difference in interactivity allows for musical scores in video game scores to\n    make an impact that is not even close to possible in films.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    In films, the prime driver of the story is the media itself. The only form of audience participation is the actual act of watching the movie itself.\n    Video games, on the other hand, are primarily driven by the actions of its audience. Therefore, they serve to provide an entirely unique\n    dimension of interactivity not found within any other form of media. This interactivity presents a completely unique experience for\n    the scoring that underlies video games.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    In films, everything is predictable. a specific scene always happens at a specific time in the media. The accompanying music, then, is always played at the\n    same time throughout the film. In modern video games, the music is far more unpredictable as it needs to actively follow the actions of the player.\n    Think about the music played during a boss battle for example. It is playing because the player performed the requisite actions needed in order to enter into the battle. Similarly,\n    it does not stop until the player either defeats or looses to the boss. The granularity can be further increased by having the music react to the actions\n    that the player chooses to perform during the battle. The solution to this problem is writing music in modules rather than as an entire composition. This way,\n    these modules can be programmed to play in response to a specific player action, with their lengths being determined by the desired amount of granularity.\n  </p>\n  <br>\n  <p>\n    As far as I am aware, this level of individual participation in the creation of music simply does not exist in any other form of media.

Seeing this missed oppurtunity in the past\r\n      was essentially the reason why my mom encouraged me to become musically literate.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Despite there being little formal musical education in my family, there was certainly still a taste\r\n      for it. My grandparents, for example, always loved to listen to Chinese operas in their free time.\r\n      My mom on the other hand, always enjoyed 80's mandopop along with some of the artists here in the US\r\n      like Celine Dion. Beyond that, I also remember her having piles of cds back in the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p>\r\n      As for my musical history, I can't say I remember a part of my life that wasn't impacted by music.\r\n      I've spent years of my life both listening to as well as playing music. I started learning the piano\r\n      in kindergarten and the violin in first grade. I got into music production in high school, and lately\r\n      I've been trying to pick up the guitar. I've also spent more money than I'd care to admit buying instruments,\r\n      hi-fi speakers and headphones, audio systems, and records.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-night-light',\r\n  templateUrl: './night-light.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./night-light.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class NightLightComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<div>\r\n    <button id= \"back\" routerLink = \"./select\">\r\n        <img src=\"./assets/icons/chevron-left.svg\" alt =\"backArrow\">\r\n        <p>Back</p>\r\n    </button>\r\n    <a href = \"https://github.com/SuperSkipper/Night-Light\">\r\n        <img src = \"./assets/icons/GitHubWhite.svg\" id= \"git\">\r\n    </a>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"content\">\r\n    <div id=\"content-body\">\r\n        <div id=\"title-block\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/white_title.png\" alt=\"white_title\" id=\"title-img\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/main-character.png\" alt=\"Main Character\" id=\"title-character\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\r\n            <img src=\"./assets/Night Light/title_screen.jpg\" id=\"ts\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Night Light is a game created during the 2018 Athens Game Jam over the\r\n                period of two days. It recieved the accolade of \"Best Overall Game\" \r\n                along with \"Best Art\" among others.
